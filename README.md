What is this Project?

This is a custom class that is subclassed from TextField class in order to provide complete filtering and formatting for Phone Numbers (10 Digit NANP Only). The Phone Formatting Textfield will automatically format while the user is typing in their 10 digit phone number. 

Users ONLY type in their digits and see a nice formatted output of (XXX)XXX-XXXX automatically. This works for keyed numbers, pasted numbers, or a combination of both.

NOTE: This project does not support International dial plan numbers - Only 10 Digit NANP numbers at this point. Feel free to fork this project, extend the code base, and then make a pull request if you would like to contribute.
