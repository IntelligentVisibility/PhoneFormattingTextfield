What is this Project?

This is a custom class that I subclassed from the TextField class in order to provide complete filtering and formatting for Phone Numbers (10 Digit NANP Only). The Phone Formatting Textfield will automatically format dynamically while the user is typing in their 10 digit phone number. All guardrails have been put into place so users ONLY type in their digits and see a nice formatted output of (XXX)XXX-XXXX automatically.

NOTE: This project in its original state does not support International number support - Only 10 Digit NANP numbers at this point. Feel free to fork this project, extend the code base, and then make a pull request if you would like to contribute.
